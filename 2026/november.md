### Worked On

Deep-Learning Tabular Prediction System — continued Phase 2 temporal feature expansion.

### Progress

- Added features describing recent changes in household power consumption:
  - 1-minute power change
  - 5-minute power change
  - 15-minute power change
  - 60-minute power change
- Added a short-term 15-minute rolling standard deviation to represent recent volatility.
- Added rolling maximum features for:
  - 15 minutes
  - 60 minutes
- Added a 60-minute rolling minimum feature.
- Created `rolling_range_60` as the difference between the recent 60-minute maximum and minimum power values.
- Continued building all temporal features using current and historical observations only to avoid future-data leakage.

### What I Learned

- Lag features describe past power levels, while change features explicitly describe the direction and magnitude of recent movement.
- Rolling standard deviation provides information about how stable or volatile recent consumption has been.
- Rolling maximum and minimum features provide information about recent local extremes.
- `rolling_range_60` summarizes how widely power consumption has moved during the previous hour.
- These features may help models distinguish between stable consumption and periods where household load is changing rapidly.
- Better temporal information may be more valuable than simply increasing neural-network complexity.

### Next Step

Inspect the distributions of the new temporal features and measure their relationships with the 60-minute-ahead target.

Then assemble the complete Phase 2 feature set, remove rows made unusable by lag/rolling calculations, and create the expanded modeling dataset.
